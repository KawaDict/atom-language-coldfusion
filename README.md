# ColdFusion language support in Atom

_(For those out there still using it...)_

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to ColdFusion file in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [ColdFusion TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/coldfusion.tmbundle).

## Deprecated / No Longer Maintained!

Sorry, folks: I no longer work for a company that develops in CF. I'd only created this port so that my back-end dev colleagues could hop onto the Atom wagon...

I recommend you switch to https://github.com/atuttle/atom-language-cfml, which is actively maintained, and they have fixed this nasty bug there already!

Thanks for being active here!
